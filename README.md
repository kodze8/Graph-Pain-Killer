### Features
- Random Graph Generation: Instantly generate diverse graph structures.
- Algorithm Visualizations: Step-by-step visual representation of 7 core graph algorithms.
- Stack/Table Views: Observe internal data structures and recursive dynamics in action.
- Verbal Explanations: Understand the logic behind each step with clear textual explanations.
- Scalable Architecture: Designed for efficiency, capable of handling larger graphs with minimal performance issues.
- Intuitive UI: Carefully designed for accessibility and smooth user experience.

### Algorithms Included
Currently, Graph PainKiller supports:

1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
2. Depth-First Search (DFS)
3. Dijkstra’s Algorithm
4. Bellman-Ford Algorithm
5. Kruskal’s Algorithm
6. Prim’s Algorithm
7. Topological Sort

(Future plans include Brooks' Algorithm for vertex coloring, graph isomorphism algorithms, and more.)
